\ressubheading{Modeling Hospital Patient Trajectories}{Sarasota, FL}{Florence A. Rothman Institute}{Au. 2018 --- Now}

\vspace{-6pt} I am studying the interactions of chronic conditions with heart failure using clustering and finite state modeling.\\

\ressubheading{Automated Tracing of Neurons}{Seatle, WA}{Allen Institute for Brain Science}{June 2018 --- Aug. 2018}

\vspace{-6pt} Implemented proof of concept for automatically tracing brain cell morphologies using deep reinforcement learning.\\ % These models will be further validated using electrophysiological \& tethered flight data to test theories about multi-modal decision making.\\



\ressubheading{\hypertarget{Mosquitogrant}Multisensory Integration in Mosquitos}{Seatle, WA}{Fairhall Lab, University of Washington}{Oct. 2014 --- May 2016}

\vspace{-6pt} I created agent-based dynamical models of mosquito thermal plume navigation using wind-tunnel flight data.\\ % These models will be further validated using electrophysiological \& tethered flight data to test theories about multi-modal decision making.\\
    

\ressubheading{\hypertarget{whalevolunteering}Humpback Whale Census}{James Price Point, Australia}{Kimberley Community Whale Research Project}{Aug. 2012 --- Oct. 2012}

\vspace{-6pt} A community-initiated peer-review of a study conducted by an oil conglomerate at the proposed site of the world's second-largest liquefied gas processing port. Our research revealed gross discrepancies in the original study.\\ %old link\href{http://tinyurl.com/JPP-humpback-whale-survey-2013}{peer-review}'s

    \ressubheading{Honors Baccalaureate Thesis}{Sarasota, FL}{Walstrom Lab, New College of Florida}{Aug. 2010 --- May 2011}

\vspace{-6pt} My capstone \hyperlink{thesispub}{thesis project} proposes a model for RNA Helicase A function in endogenous \emph{C. elegans} RNAi pathways based on qRT-PCR experiments.\\ % My baccalaureate exam was administered by a committee of faculty and consisted of a thesis defense followed by a comprehensive oral exam covering all courses I took at New College.\\

    \ressubheading{Independent Tutorials}{Sarasota, FL}{New College of Florida}{Aug. 2007 --- May 2011}
    
\vspace{-6pt} I created courses with faculty supervision using New College's tutorial system. Highlights: ``Quantitative RT-PCR", ``Floridian Invasive Species", and ``Synthesis of P450-like Complex".\\

    \ressubheading{Genomics Outreach for Minorities Project (NSF-REU)}{Seattle, WA}{Pallanck Lab, University of Washington}{May 2010 --- Aug. 2010}
    
\vspace{-6pt} I helped establish a method to grow, stain, and image primary dopaminergic neural culture from \textit{Drosophila} embryos in order to test whether Parkin and PINK1, proteins involved in Parkinson's disease, are recruited to depolarized mitochondria in dopaminergic neurons. This research was \hyperlink{neuronpub}{published} in \textit{PNAS}.\\

%    \ressubheading{Lab Technician}{Sarasota, FL}{New College of Florida Dept. of Natural Sciences}{Feb. 2010 --- Sep. 2010}
%    Routine duties for the department, including autoclaving and disposing lab waste, preparing and sterilized solutions and agar plates, and preparing lab courses as needed. \\

    \ressubheading{Organic Synthesis of P450-like Molecule}{Sarasota, FL}{Scudder Lab, New College of Florida}{Sep. 2008 --- Nov. 2009}
    
\vspace{-6pt} I partially synthesized precursors to a novel high-valent iron-stabilizing macrocycle based on the active site of cytochrome P450.\\

    \ressubheading{Summer Undergraduate Research Program (NSF-REU)}{Pittsburgh, PA}{McCartney Lab, Carnegie Mellon University}{May 2009 --- Aug. 2009}

\vspace{-6pt} I determined that APC2, a protein with probable roles in colon cancer tumorogenesis, did not interact with $\beta$-catenin of the Wnt pathway's destruction complex. I determined that APC2's conserved N-terminal domain was not essential for its proper localization. This research was \hyperlink{carnegiepub}{published} in \textit{Genetics}.\\


\ressubheading{GC and HPLC Instrumental Analysis}{Sarasota, FL}{McCord Lab, New College of Florida}{Jan. 2008}

\vspace{-6pt} An independent study project where I learned how to operate liquid chromatographs and analyze their spectra.\\
