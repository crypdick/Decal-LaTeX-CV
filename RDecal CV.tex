\vspace{-6pt} Establish a method to grow, stain, and image primary dopaminergic neural cultures from \textit{Drosophila} embryos. I tested whether Parkin and PINK1, proteins involved in Parkinson's disease, are recruited to depolarized mitochondria in dopaminergic neurons. This research was \hyperlink{neuronpub}{published} in \textit{PNAS}.\\

    \ressubheading{Functional Study of APC2 Protein}{Pittsburgh, PA}{McCartney Lab, Carnegie Mellon University}{May 2009 --- Aug. 2009}
    
\vspace{-6pt} I determined that APC2, a protein  with roles in colon cancer tumorogenesis, did not directly interact with $\beta$-catenin of the Wnt pathway's destruction complex. I disproved the theory that APC2's N-terminal domain was essential for its proper localization. This research was \hyperlink{carnegiepub}{published} in \textit{Genetics}.\\
